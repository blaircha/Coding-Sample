# Coding Sample

This is the sample code for my Statistics capstone project, ``Investigating the Causes of Suicide Across Nations: A Mixed-Effect Model Approach.`` I use a mixed-effect model with the random slope effect to conduct longitudinal data analysis. 

It is composed of five steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Fitting Mixed Effects Models
3. Hypothesis Testing and Information Criteria
4. Diagnostics
5. Conclusion and Limitations
